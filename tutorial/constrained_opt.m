%% Constrained Optimization and Parameter Estimation
% There are three places in this algorithm when constrained optimization is
% used to estimate different parameters:
%%
% * Estimation of neural activity
% * Estimation of the spatial footprint of each neuron
% * Estimation of calcium concentration
%%
% It is therefore important to understand what it means to optimize an
% objective function subject to constraints. This section will briefly
% explain constrained optimization and introduce the specific functions
% being optimized here.

%% Constrained Optimization
% Problems of constrained optimization are those in which we wish to find a
% minimum (or maximum) value of a function $f(x,y)$ subject to some
% constraint $g(x,y) = c$. The functions $f$ and $g$ are referred to as the
% objective function and constraint, respectively. Let's consider an
% example:
xy = meshgrid((1:10),(1:10));
objective = sin
