Extra notes on the DFF signal simulation: (based on the methods sections of the corresponding paper)
  1. Spikes are modeled as a Poisson point process with some firing rate.
  2. In the linear model, the spike train is transformed into a fluorescence signal by convolving
     with the single-AP evoked calcium transient. This impulse response is modeled with a rapidly rising
     then exponentially decaying function parameterized with both an onset and decay time constant.
     This linear model is sufficient to simulate low firing rates since it assumes that the calcium
     concentration is well below the dissociation constant (?) in order to linearize the transformation
     between calcium and DFF.
  3. To better simulate higher firing rates, the model adds some dynamics regarding the saturation of 
     the calcium indicator in the cell characterized by exogenous and endogenous binding ratios (though
     these are not public parameters in the simulation code). These parameters are used to model a different
     calcium time course based on spike times. Smoothing happens.Then, the nonlinear version of the 
     transformation from calcium to DFF is used. (??? This part confuses me the most.)
  4. Gaussian white noise is added to the time courses.
  5. Time courses are downsampled. (I think this is done so that the spike timing is very precise, but not
     the calcium imaging data.)
